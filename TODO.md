- As a user, I can already edit a bookmark and select the groups it can belongs to.
I want the user to use the same mecanism for copying groups in other tabs.

- User must be able to sort manually bookmarks in a group (by drag and drop)
- User must be able to sort manually sections (by drag and drop)


# Dev tool
