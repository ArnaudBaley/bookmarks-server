# Features

- I want you to store the favicon instead of download them every time. In the settings menu, a button will be available to update all favicons. When user delete his data, it will also delete favicons.


# Dev tool

- Analyse the unit test performance and see if you can increase it 

- I want eslint and prettier on the codebase. It must lint and format at every save.

- UI tests in docker instead from host
