- Check that e2e tests covers main features. For example, deleting a tab is not covered.

- When user click on the option icon on a bookmark, instead of directly open the modal, it will replace the button by a modify icon and add a button delete on the left of the modify icon.

- On the header, create a settings icons. When user click on it, it will open a popup that will include those features : theme switch, export and import. 

- UI tests in docker instead from host

- User must be able to sort manually sections
