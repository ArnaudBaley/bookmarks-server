# Bugs


# UI

- Use only one add icon that will unfold the other buttons : the group creation and the tab creation.


# Tests

- Check that e2e tests covers main features. For example, deleting a tab is not covered.
Change the settings icon. I want a toothed wheel.

# Features

- Each group can be copy or moved to another tab

- UI tests in docker instead from host

- User must be able to sort manually sections
